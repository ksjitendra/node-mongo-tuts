// In this code snippet, we use the Express.js framework to create an HTTP server. The /payment-callback endpoint is set up to handle POST requests from the payment gateway. Inside the endpoint handler, we verify the authenticity of the payment callback using the verifyPaymentCallback function. You should implement your own verification logic here, which might include checking digital signatures or using API keys provided by the payment gateway.

// If the payment callback is valid, we process the payment by calling the processPayment function. In this function, you can implement your payment processing logic, such as updating the database, sending confirmation emails, or triggering other actions based on the payment information received from the payment gateway.

// Regarding security policies, here are some best practices to keep in mind:

// Authentication and Authorization: Ensure that the payment gateway callbacks are authenticated and authorized before processing them. Use secure mechanisms provided by the payment gateway, such as digital signatures or API keys, to verify the authenticity of the callbacks.

// Input Validation: Validate and sanitize the input received from the payment gateway to prevent common security vulnerabilities like injection attacks or cross-site scripting (XSS). Verify that the received data matches the expected format and data types.

// Secure Communication: Use HTTPS with TLS/SSL to establish a secure connection between your Node.js application and the payment gateway. This prevents eavesdropping, data tampering, and man-in-the-middle attacks.

// Secure Storage of Sensitive Data: If you need to store sensitive payment information, such as credit card details, follow best practices for secure storage, like encrypting the data and using industry-standard encryption algorithms. Avoid storing sensitive data longer than necessary.

// Error Handling: Implement appropriate error handling mechanisms to handle any unexpected errors that might occur during payment processing. Avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages returned to the payment gateway.

// Logging and Monitoring: Implement logging and monitoring mechanisms to track and investigate any suspicious activity related to payment callbacks. Monitor your application for potential security breaches and promptly address any issues.

// validate strip webhook request 
// Function to verify the authenticity of the payment callback using a key
function verifyPaymentCallback(payload) {
    const paymentGatewayKey = 'YOUR_PAYMENT_GATEWAY_KEY';
  
    // Compare the key received in the payload with the expected payment gateway key
    // You might need to consult the payment gateway documentation to find the appropriate key
    if (payload.key === paymentGatewayKey) {
      // Key matches, so the payment callback is valid
      return true;
    }
  
    // Key does not match, so the payment callback is invalid
